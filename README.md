# Saugeen-Cottages
A program used to calculate the cost of a cottage rental at Sunset Cottage Park in Saugeen Shores, ON.
This is based on the time of year, the number of time the user is renting for, and if they have a SSCR (Saugeen Sunset Cottage Rentals) membership. All these parameters 
change the final cost.

The program is written in Java and is interacted with by just the console. It imports the scanner class to read from the console.
